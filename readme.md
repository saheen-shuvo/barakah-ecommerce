# Local Development Setup

## 1. Clone the repository

git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd barakah-demo-project

---

# Frontend Setup

cd barakah-client
npm install

Create a `.env.local` file based on:

.env.example

Example:

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_cloudinary_upload_preset
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

### Development

The project can be started with Webpack using:

npm run dev -- --webpack

Then open:

http://localhost:3000

### Production Build

npm run build

Start the production server:

npm start

---

# Backend Setup

cd barakah-server
npm install

Create a `.env` file based on:

.env.example

Example:

PORT=8000

DB_NAME=your_database_name
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

STEADFAST_API_URL=https://portal.packzy.com/api/v1
STEADFAST_API_KEY_NARAYANGANJ=your_api_key
STEADFAST_SECRET_KEY_NARAYANGANJ=your_secret_key

### Start Backend

npm start

For development:

npm run dev

The backend will run on the port configured in `.env`.

---

# Environment Variables

The repository contains:

.env.example

for both the frontend and backend.

The actual environment files are intentionally excluded from Git.

Never commit:

.env
.env.local
.env.production

Environment variables must be configured separately for each deployment environment.

---

# Database

The application uses MongoDB.

MongoDB can be hosted through:

* MongoDB Atlas
* A self-hosted MongoDB server

The MongoDB connection string is configured through:

MONGODB_URI

The database credentials are not included in this repository.

---

# Image Storage

Product images are uploaded through Cloudinary.

Configure the frontend Cloudinary variables in:

barakah-client/.env.local

Required variables:

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_cloudinary_upload_preset

---

# Production Deployment

The application consists of two services:

Frontend
Next.js
     ↓
Backend
Express.js
     ↓
MongoDB


For shared hosting/cPanel deployment, the frontend and backend should be configured as Node.js applications.

### Frontend

The Next.js application should run in production mode:

npm run build
npm start

### Backend

The Express application should run using its configured startup file and production environment variables.

The exact cPanel configuration depends on the hosting provider's Node.js application settings.

---

# Security

Never expose or commit:

* MongoDB credentials
* JWT secrets
* Courier API keys
* Courier secret keys
* Gmail app passwords
* Cloudinary API secrets
* BDC API keys
* Pathao credentials
* Other private API credentials

Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.

---

# Important Deployment Notes

### Courier APIs

Some courier integrations may require server IP whitelisting.

The hosting/server public IP may need to be provided to the courier provider before the API can be used.

### CORS

The backend must allow requests from the production frontend domain.

Update the backend CORS configuration when changing the frontend domain.

### API URL

The production frontend must use the production backend URL:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com

---

# Troubleshooting

## Frontend does not start

Try:

rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run dev -- --webpack

For production:

npm run build
npm start

## Backend cannot connect to MongoDB

Check:

MONGODB_URI

Make sure:

* MongoDB is running or MongoDB Atlas is accessible
* Credentials are correct
* The server IP is allowed by MongoDB Atlas
* The database name is correct

## API requests fail

Check:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL

Make sure it points to the correct backend URL.

Also verify the backend CORS configuration.

# Source Code Handover

This repository contains the source code for:

* Next.js frontend
* Express.js backend
* Configuration examples
* Project documentation

Sensitive credentials and production environment files are intentionally excluded.

##The client should configure their own:

* Database
* Cloudinary account
* Courier accounts/API credentials
* Email account
* Analytics accounts
* Production environment variables
